\section{Section Heading}
\label{sec:1}

Use the template \emph{pt-ai-author.tex} together with the Springer document class
SVMult (for edited books) to style the various elements of your chapter content in
the Springer layout.

Much of this text is nonsense copied from the Springer author sample file. Some of it
explains how the formatting is done, however.

Instead of simply listing headings of different levels we recommend to let every
heading be followed by at least a short passage of text. Please also use the \LaTeX\
mechanisms for all your cross-references and citations. And please note that the
first line of text that follows a heading is not indented, whereas the first lines of
all subsequent paragraphs are.

\section{Section Heading}
\label{sec:2}
% Always give a unique label
% and use \ref{<label>} for cross-references
% and \cite{<label>} for bibliographic references
% use \sectionmark{}
% to alter or adjust the section heading in the running head
Instead of simply listing headings of different levels we recommend to
let every heading be followed by at least a short passage of text.
Further, please also use the \LaTeX\ and BibTeX mechanisms for all your
cross-references, citations and bibliography listing.

Please note that the first line of text that follows a heading is not indented, whereas the first lines of all subsequent paragraphs are.

Use the standard \verb|equation| environment to typeset your equations, e.g.
%
\begin{equation}
a \times b = c\;,
\end{equation}
%
however, for multiline equations we recommend to use the \verb|eqnarray| environment\footnote{In physics texts please activate the class option \texttt{vecphys} to depict your vectors in \textbf{\itshape boldface-italic} type - as is customary for a wide range of physical subjects}.
\begin{eqnarray}
a \times b = c \nonumber\\
\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}=\vec{c}
\label{eq:01}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Subsection Heading}
\label{subsec:2}
Instead of simply listing headings of different levels we recommend to
let every heading be followed by at least a short passage of text.

Please also use the \LaTeX\ mechanisms for all your
cross-references\index{cross-references} and citations\index{citations}
as has already been described in Sect.~\ref{sec:2}.

\begin{quotation}
Please do not use quotation marks when quoting texts! Simply use the \verb|quotation|
environment -- it will automatically render Springer's preferred layout, as in this
example paragraph.
\end{quotation}


\subsubsection{Subsubsection Heading}
Instead of simply listing headings of different levels we recommend to
let every heading be followed by at least a short passage of text.
Further on please use the \LaTeX\ mechanisms for all your
cross-references and citations as has already been described in
Sect.~\ref{subsec:2}, see also Fig.~\ref{fig:1}\footnote{If you copy
text passages, figures, or tables from other works, you must obtain
\textit{permission} from the copyright holder (usually the original
publisher). Please enclose the signed permission with the manucript. The
sources\index{permission to print} must be acknowledged either in the
captions, as footnotes or in a separate section of the book.}

Please note that the first line of text that follows a heading is not indented,
whereas the first lines of all subsequent paragraphs are.


\paragraph{Paragraph Heading} %
Instead of simply listing headings of different levels we recommend to
let every heading be followed by at least a short passage of text.
Further on please use the \LaTeX\ mechanisms for all your
cross-references and citations as has already been described in
Sect.~\ref{sec:2}.

Please note that the first line of text that follows a heading is not indented, whereas the first lines of all subsequent paragraphs are.

For typesetting numbered lists we recommend to use the \verb|enumerate| environment -- it will automatically render Springer's preferred layout.

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Livelihood and survival mobility are oftentimes outcomes of uneven socioeconomic development.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Livelihood and survival mobility are oftentimes outcomes of uneven socioeconomic development.}
\item{Livelihood and survival mobility are oftentimes outcomes of uneven socioeconomic development.}

\end{enumerate}


% For figures use
%
\begin{figure}[h]
%% Try to insert the figure 'here' (!h), If it does not fit, it may be placed at
%% the top of the next page.
% Use the relevant command for your figure-insertion program
% to insert the figure file.
% For example, with the graphicx style use this, to get the figure centred.
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figure}}
%
% If no graphics program available, insert a blank space i.e. use
%\picplace{5cm}{2cm} % Give the correct figure height and width in cm
%
\caption{This is how a normal figure caption will appear, below the figure. Another
example is given below in Fig.~\ref{fig:2}, using the \texttt{sidecaption}
command. }
\label{fig:1}       % Give a unique label
\end{figure}

\subparagraph{Subparagraph Heading}
In order to avoid simply listing headings of different levels we recommend letting
every heading be followed by at least a short passage of text.


\subparagraph{Cross-references}
Use the \LaTeX\ mechanisms for all your cross-references and citations as has already
been described
in Sect.~\ref{sec:2}, see also Fig.~\ref{fig:1} and Fig.~\ref{fig:2}.
In contrast, Sect.~\ref{sec:subsec} illustrates a subsection reference.


\subparagraph{Unnumbered lists}
For unnumbered list we recommend to use the \verb|itemize| environment -- it will automatically render Springer's preferred layout.

\begin{itemize}
\item{Livelihood and survival mobility are oftentimes outcomes of uneven socioeconomic development, cf. Table~\ref{tab:1}.}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Livelihood and survival mobility are oftentimes outcomes of uneven socioeconomic development.}
\item{Livelihood and survival mobility are oftentimes outcomes of uneven socioeconomic development.}

%
%\caption{Please write your figure caption here}
\caption{If the width of the figure is less than 7.8 cm use the \texttt{sidecapion} command
to set the caption flush on the left side of the page. If the figure is positioned at
the top of the page, align the sidecaption with the top of the figure -- to achieve
this you simply need to use the optional argument \texttt{[t]} with the
\texttt{sidecaption} command}

Please note that the first line of text that follows a heading is not indented, whereas the first lines of all subsequent paragraphs are.

If you want to list definitions or the like we recommend to use the Springer-enhanced \verb|description| environment -- it will automatically render Springer's preferred layout.

\begin{description}[Type 1]
\item[Type 1]{That addresses central themes pertainng to migration, health, and disease. In Sect.~\ref{sec:1}, Wilson discusses the role of human migration in infectious disease distributions and patterns.}

\section*{Appendix}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Appendix}
%
%
When placed at the end of a chapter or contribution (as opposed to at the end of the book),
the numbering of tables, figures, and equations in the appendix section continues on from
that in the main text. Hence please \textit{do not} use the \verb|appendix| command when
writing an appendix at the end of your chapter or contribution.
If there is only one the appendix is designated ``Appendix'', or ``Appendix 1'', or
``Appendix 2'', etc. if there is more than one.

\begin{equation}
a \times b = c
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
X \times Y = Z
\end{equation}

\section{Reference Formats}

References may be \textit{cited} in the text by author/year.\footnote{Make
sure that all references from the list are cited in the text.
Those not cited should be moved to a separate \textit{Further Reading}
section or chapter.}
The reference list should be \textit{sorted} in alphabetical order.
If there are several works by the same author, the following order should be used:
\begin{enumerate}
\item all works by the author alone, ordered chronologically by year of publication
\item all works by the author with a coauthor, ordered alphabetically by coauthor
\item all works by the author with several coauthors, ordered chronologically by year of publication.
\end{enumerate}
The \textit{styling} of references\footnote{Always use the standard abbreviation of a journal's name according to the ISSN \textit{List of Title Word Abbreviations}, see \url{http://www.issn.org/en/node/344}}
depends on the subject of your book:
\begin{itemize}
\item The \textit{two} recommended styles for references in books on \textit{mathematical, physical, statistical and computer sciences} are
not depicted here.
\item Examples of the basic Springer style, \texttt{spbasic},
used in the PT-AI proceedings
are \cite{calfee-1991}, \cite{dod-1999}, \cite{harris-et-al}, and
\cite{oneil-et-al}
\end{itemize}
